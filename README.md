# React tools

Commonly reused pieces of tooling for React projects. See [the documentation](./docs/README.md).

Supports tree-shaking, so no bloating your bundle size.

Comes with TypeScript types if you use TypeScript.

```sh
npm install --save @denis-sokolov/react
```

## Browser support

For the most part the library is not using any newer APIs. That said, if you support browsers with less than 2% of the market (Internet Explorer, Safari before 14, Chrome before 88), take a second look whether everything works well.
